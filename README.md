# Healthcare Translation Web App Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

The **Healthcare Translation Web App** is a web-based prototype designed to enable real-time, multilingual translation between patients and healthcare providers. This application converts spoken input into text, provides a live transcript, and offers a translated version with audio playback. The project showcases technical proficiency, development speed, and the effective use of generative AI for efficient healthcare communication.

## 2. Scope and Features

### **Key Features:**

- **Voice-to-Text with Generative AI:** Converts spoken input into a text transcript, enhancing transcription accuracy, particularly for medical terms.
- **Real-Time Translation and Audio Playback:** Provides real-time translation of the transcript with a "Speak" button for audio playback.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Ensures responsiveness and optimization for both mobile and desktop devices.

## 3. Technology Stack

The project utilizes modern web technologies and AI tools:

- **Frontend:** Vite, React, TypeScript
- **AI APIs:** Gemini AI (for text translation), Web Speech Recognition API (for voice-to-text conversion)
- **Styling:** CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel
